# Encrypt Decrypt 🔐

> Master the Art of Cryptography, One Puzzle at a Time!

An interactive educational game built with Next.js that teaches classical cryptography through hands-on gameplay. Players learn about substitution ciphers by encrypting and decrypting messages in timed challenges.

## 🎮 Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Learn cryptography through gameplay rather than theory
- **Multiple Cipher Types**: Practice with 4 different substitution algorithms
- **Timed Challenges**: 60-second rounds to test your speed and accuracy
- **Dual Mode Gameplay**: Both encryption and decryption challenges
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Animated UI**: Smooth transitions and engaging visual feedback

## 🧮 Supported Algorithms

### Caesar Cipher
One of the oldest ciphers, used by Julius Caesar to secure military messages. Shifts letters forward by a fixed amount (default: 3 positions).

### Atbash Cipher
An ancient cipher from Hebrew cryptography where the alphabet is reversed (A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, etc.). Applying it twice returns the original text.

### ROT13
A special case of the Caesar cipher that shifts letters by 13 places. Commonly used in internet forums to obscure spoilers.

### Polybius Square
Developed by Greek historian Polybius, converts letters into numerical coordinates based on a 5×5 grid (e.g., A = 11, B = 12).

## 🎯 How to Play
